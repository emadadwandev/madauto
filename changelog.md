## [Date: 2025-10-23] - Dynamic Currency Support, Authorization & Invitation Fixes

### Fixed - Invitation Route Parameter Error
- **Route Parameter Order & Type Mismatch** causing errors on invitation actions
  - Files:
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/InvitationController.php` (modified)
    - `resources/views/dashboard/invitations/index.blade.php` (modified)
  - Issue: Multiple errors when trying to resend/delete invitations
    - First error: `POST /dashboard/invitations/4/resend` returned 404 Not Found
    - Second error: `TypeError: Argument #1 ($invitation) must be of type App\Models\Invitation, string given`
    - Third error: Persistent 404 after fixing controller
  - Root Causes:
    1. **Controller issue**: Laravel's implicit route model binding requires specific configuration
       - Route parameter `{invitation}` was being passed as string, not bound to model
       - Attempted to use implicit binding but it wasn't configured properly
    2. **View issue**: Route parameters passed in wrong order to `route()` helper
       - Domain-based routing pattern: `{subdomain}.localhost/dashboard/invitations/{invitation}/resend`
       - View was passing: `['subdomain' => ..., 'invitation' => ...]` (wrong order)
       - Should pass: `['invitation' => ..., 'subdomain' => ...]` (correct order)
  - Fixes Applied:
    1. **Controller**: Reverted to explicit parameter handling with manual model lookup
       - Changed `resend($invitationId)` → `resend(Request $request, $invitation)`
       - Changed `destroy($invitationId)` → `destroy(Request $request, $invitation)`
       - Added manual `Invitation::findOrFail($invitation)` for proper model retrieval
    2. **View**: Fixed parameter order in `route()` helper calls
       - Changed from: `route('...resend', ['subdomain' => ..., 'invitation' => ...])`
       - Changed to: `route('...resend', ['invitation' => ..., 'subdomain' => ...])`
  - Benefits:
    - **Reliable**: Works without additional route binding configuration
    - **Clear errors**: 404 if invitation doesn't exist
    - **Tenant safety**: Explicit tenant ownership verification
    - **Correct URLs**: Route helper generates proper subdomain URLs
  - Impact: Resend and delete invitation actions now work correctly

### Fixed - Controller Authorization Error
- **Base Controller Missing Traits** causing authorization failures
  - Files: `app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php` (modified)
  - Issue: `Call to undefined method authorize()` error when sending invitations
  - Fix: Added required Laravel traits:
    - `Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\Access\AuthorizesRequests`: Enables `authorize()` method
    - `Illuminate\Foundation\Validation\ValidatesRequests`: Enables validation helpers
  - Impact: All controllers can now use authorization and validation methods
  - Affected Features: Team invitations, user management, resource authorization

### Fixed - Mailtrap Integration with Official Package
- **Integrated Official Mailtrap PHP Package** for Laravel
  - Files:
    - `composer.json` (modified) - Added `railsware/mailtrap-php` v3.9.0
    - `config/mail.php` (modified) - Added `mailtrap-sdk` transport
    - `config/services.php` (modified) - Added Mailtrap SDK configuration
    - `.env.example` (modified) - Updated with Mailtrap SDK settings
  - Issue: Multiple errors when attempting to send invitations
    - `Mailer [mailtrap] is not defined` - Invalid mailer name
    - `Unsupported mail transport [mailtrap]` - Wrong transport name
  - Root Cause: Mailtrap package uses `mailtrap-sdk` as transport name, not `mailtrap`
  - Solution: Properly integrated official Mailtrap Laravel package
    - Package: `railsware/mailtrap-php` v3.9.0
    - Dependencies: `symfony/http-client`, `nyholm/psr7`, `php-http/*`
    - Auto-discovery: Service provider auto-registered via package discovery
    - Integration: Laravel 9.x+ compatible (Symfony Mailer transport)
  - Configuration Added to `config/mail.php`:
    ```php
    'mailers' => [
        'mailtrap-sdk' => [
            'transport' => 'mailtrap-sdk',  // Note: 'mailtrap-sdk' not 'mailtrap'
        ],
    ],
    ```
  - Configuration Added to `config/services.php`:
    ```php
    'mailtrap-sdk' => [
        'host' => env('MAILTRAP_HOST', 'sandbox.api.mailtrap.io'),
        'apiKey' => env('MAILTRAP_API_KEY'),
        'inboxId' => env('MAILTRAP_INBOX_ID'),
    ],
    ```
  - Required `.env` Changes:
    ```env
    MAIL_MAILER=mailtrap-sdk                # Use 'mailtrap-sdk' (with hyphen and 'sdk')
    MAILTRAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here     # From https://mailtrap.io/api-tokens
    MAILTRAP_HOST=sandbox.api.mailtrap.io  # For testing (sandbox mode)
    MAILTRAP_INBOX_ID=your_inbox_id        # Your Mailtrap inbox ID
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@yourapp.com"
    MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
    ```
  - Benefits Over SMTP Approach:
    - **API-based**: More reliable than SMTP
    - **Feature-rich**: Supports sandbox/production/bulk modes
    - **Better errors**: Clear API error messages with status codes
    - **Laravel integration**: Native Symfony Mailer transport
    - **Auto-discovery**: Automatically registers service provider
  - Available Hosts:
    - `sandbox.api.mailtrap.io` - Testing/development (emails don't send)
    - `send.api.mailtrap.io` - Production (sends real emails)
    - `bulk.api.mailtrap.io` - Bulk campaigns
  - Impact: Invitation emails and all mail features now work properly

    - `POST /tenants`: Store new tenant
  - Organization: Routes ordered logically (list → create → show → edit → update)
  - Security: All routes protected by `auth`, `verified`, `super-admin` middleware

### Technical Implementation
- **Platform Control Architecture**:
  - Super admin can enable/disable platforms per tenant
  - Auto-accept settings control order processing behavior
  - Settings stored as structured JSON for flexibility
  - Frontend presents user-friendly form interface
  - Backend validates and structures data consistently

- **Tenant Creation Workflow**:
  1. Super admin fills creation form
  2. System validates all inputs
  3. Database transaction begins
  4. Tenant record created with settings
  5. Admin user created and linked to tenant
  6. User assigned tenant_admin role

    "auto_accept_careem": true,
    "auto_accept_talabat": false,
    "timezone": "Asia/Dubai",
    "currency": "AED",
    "language": "en",
    "notify_on_new_order": true,
    "notify_on_failed_sync": true,
    "notify_on_usage_limit": true
  }
  ```

### Fixed - Tenant Edit Form Errors
- **Missing Domain Field** in edit view
  - Files: `resources/views/super-admin/tenants/edit.blade.php` (modified)
  - Issue: "Undefined array key 'domain'" error when editing tenants
  - Fix: Added custom domain input field with null coalescing operator
  - Result: Tenants can now be edited without errors

- **Controller Null Safety** improvements
  - Files: `app/Http/Controllers/SuperAdmin/TenantController.php` (modified)
  - Added: Null coalescing operators for nullable fields (domain, trial_ends_at)
  - Result: More robust handling of optional fields

- **Missing Subscription Usage Relationship**
  - Files: `app/Models/Subscription.php` (modified)
  - Issue: "Call to undefined relationship [usage] on model [App\Models\Subscription]"
  - Problem: SubscriptionController calling `->usage` but model only had `->usageRecords`
  - Fix: Added `usage()` method as an alias to `usageRecords()` relationship
  - Result: Subscription views now load without relationship errors

- **NotificationController Middleware Error**
  - Files:
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Controller.php` (modified)
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/NotificationController.php` (modified)
  - Issue: "Call to undefined method NotificationController::middleware()"
  - Problem: Laravel 11 base controller structure doesn't include middleware() method by default
  - Fix:
    - Updated base Controller to use Laravel 11 minimal structure
    - Removed middleware call from NotificationController constructor (routes already protected)
  - Result: Notification settings page loads without errors

- **Tenant Admin Role Assignment Issue - 403 Forbidden on Team Page**
  - Files: `app/Http/Controllers/SuperAdmin/TenantController.php` (modified)
  - Issue: Users created by super admin couldn't access team management (403 Forbidden error)
  - Root Cause:
    - Role was attached without `tenant_id` in the pivot table
    - TeamPolicy checks `hasRole('tenant_admin', $tenant)` which requires tenant_id in pivot
    - Database query: `SELECT * FROM role_user WHERE user_id = ? AND role_id = ? AND tenant_id = ?`
    - Missing tenant_id caused role check to fail
  - Fix:
    - Changed from `$user->roles()->attach($tenantAdminRole->id)`
    - To: `$user->assignRole($tenantAdminRole, $tenant->id)`
    - Uses Role::TENANT_ADMIN constant for consistency
    - The `assignRole()` method properly includes tenant_id in pivot data
  - Result:
    - Tenant admin users can now access team management
    - Proper role-based authorization working correctly
    - Role checks with tenant context functioning as designed
  - Note: RegistrationController already implements this correctly (lines 83-85)

- **Missing ApiCredentialRepository Methods**
  - Files: `app/Repositories/ApiCredentialRepository.php` (modified)
  - Issue: "Call to undefined method ApiCredentialRepository::getByService()"
  - Problem: OnboardingController called missing repository methods
  - Fix: Added missing repository methods:
    - `getByService($service)`: Returns ApiCredential model for a service
    - `upsert($service, $type, $value, $tenantId)`: Create or update credentials
    - `deleteByService($service, $tenantId)`: Delete credentials by service
  - Result:
    - Onboarding flow works correctly
    - Credential management methods available for future use
    - Proper separation of concerns with repository pattern

- **Onboarding Route Subdomain Parameter Issue**
  - Files: `resources/views/dashboard/onboarding/index.blade.php` (modified)
  - Issue: "Missing required parameter for [Route: dashboard.onboarding.loyverse.save] [URI: dashboard/onboarding/loyverse/save] [Missing parameter: subdomain]"
  - Problem:
    - Onboarding routes defined in `routes/tenant.php` with subdomain pattern `{subdomain}.{$domain}`
    - View route() calls didn't pass subdomain parameter explicitly
    - Laravel requires subdomain parameter when generating URLs for tenant routes
  - Fix: Updated all route() calls to explicitly pass subdomain parameter:
    - Line 110: `route('dashboard.onboarding.loyverse.save', ['subdomain' => tenant()->subdomain])`
    - Line 126: `route('dashboard.onboarding.skip', ['subdomain' => tenant()->subdomain])`
    - Line 190: `route('dashboard.onboarding.webhook.generate', ['subdomain' => tenant()->subdomain])`
    - Line 194: `route('dashboard.onboarding.skip', ['subdomain' => tenant()->subdomain])` (duplicate skip link)
    - Line 266: `route('dashboard.onboarding.complete', ['subdomain' => tenant()->subdomain])`
  - Result:
    - Users can complete onboarding flow from signup without errors
    - All onboarding forms now submit to correct tenant-scoped URLs
    - Subdomain routing works correctly throughout onboarding wizard

### Benefits
- **Improved UX**: Form inputs are more intuitive than JSON editing
- **Better Validation**: Field-level validation prevents errors
- **Platform Control**: Super admin has fine-grained platform management
- **Flexibility**: JSON storage allows for future setting additions
- **Consistency**: Helper methods ensure consistent setting access
- **Safety**: Transaction-based tenant creation prevents partial failures
- **Scalability**: Settings structure supports multi-platform growth
- **Robust**: Proper null handling prevents undefined key errors

## [Date: 2025-10-21] - Subdomain Route Parameter Fix

### Fixed - Controller Methods Missing Subdomain Parameter
- **Error**: `App\Http\Controllers\Dashboard\MenuController::edit(): Argument #1 ($menu) must be of type App\Models\Menu, string given`
- **Root Cause**: Multi-tenant domain routing `{subdomain}.localhost` creates subdomain parameter that Laravel passes to controller methods, but controllers weren't expecting it
- **Analysis**: Stack trace showed Laravel passing TWO parameters: `('ema', Object(App\Models\Menu))` but controller only expected one
- **Solution**: Updated ALL controller methods with model parameters to accept `string $subdomain` as first parameter

**Files Changed (30 methods total)**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/MenuController.php` - 8 methods (show, edit, update, destroy, toggle, publish, unpublish, duplicate)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/MenuItemController.php` - 8 methods (create, store, edit, update, destroy, toggleAvailability, reorder, duplicate)  
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/LocationController.php` - 5 methods (edit, update, destroy, toggleBusy, toggle)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/ModifierController.php` - 4 methods (edit, update, destroy, toggle)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/ModifierGroupController.php` - 5 methods (show, edit, update, destroy, toggle)

**Pattern Applied**:
```php
// Before (Incorrect)
public function edit(Menu $menu)

// After (Fixed)  
public function edit(string $subdomain, Menu $menu)
```

**Domain Route Configuration** (in `bootstrap/app.php`):
```php
Route::domain("{subdomain}.{$domain}")
    ->middleware(['web', 'identify.tenant', 'debug.auth'])
    ->group(base_path('routes/tenant.php'));
```

**Parameter Passing Order**: Laravel passes domain parameters first, then URL path parameters
- Domain: `{subdomain}` → `string $subdomain`
- Path: `{menu}` → `Menu $menu` (route model binding still works)

**Result**: ✅ All 30 controller methods now receive correct parameters in correct order
**Security**: ✅ Tenant isolation maintained - route model binding still applies tenant scoping
**Impact**: Restores full functionality to all dashboard CRUD operations

## [Date: 2025-10-21] - Menu & MenuItem Controller Bug Fixes

### Fixed - Missing Subdomain Parameters in Menu/MenuItem Redirects
- **Error**: `Missing required parameter for [Route: dashboard.menus.edit] [URI: dashboard/menus/{menu}/edit] [Missing parameter: menu]`
- **Root Cause**: Route redirects were missing subdomain parameters in MenuController and MenuItemController
- **Solution**: Updated all redirect routes to include subdomain parameter

**Files Fixed**:
1. `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/MenuController.php` - 4 routes fixed:
   - `store()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.edit` with menu and subdomain
   - `update()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.index` with subdomain
   - `destroy()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.index` with subdomain
   - `duplicate()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.edit` with menu and subdomain

2. `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/MenuItemController.php` - 4 routes fixed:
   - `store()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.edit` with menu and subdomain
   - `update()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.edit` with menu and subdomain
   - `destroy()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.edit` with menu and subdomain
   - `duplicate()` → redirect to `dashboard.menus.edit` with menu and subdomain

**Pattern Applied**:
```php
// Before
return redirect()->route('dashboard.menus.edit', $menu)

// After
return redirect()->route('dashboard.menus.edit', ['menu' => $menu, 'subdomain' => request()->route('subdomain')])
```

**Result**: ✅ Menu creation, editing, and duplication now work correctly with proper subdomain routing

---

## [Date: 2025-10-21] - Location Controller Bug Fix

### Fixed - Null Pointer Exception in LocationController
- **Error**: `Call to a member function locations() on null` at LocationController.php:16
- **Root Cause**: Attempting to access `auth()->user()->tenant->locations()` when tenant relationship wasn't loaded
- **Solution**: Changed to direct query filtering by tenant_id instead of relationship
  ```php
  // Before
  $locations = auth()->user()->tenant->locations()->paginate(12);
  
  // After
  $tenant_id = auth()->user()->tenant_id;
  $locations = Location::where('tenant_id', $tenant_id)->paginate(12);
  ```
- **Files Changed**: `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/LocationController.php`
- **Result**: ✅ Location listing now works correctly without null errors

---

## [Date: 2025-10-21] - Critical Subdomain Parameter Fixes - Menu & Modifier Management

### Fixed - CRITICAL BUG: Missing Subdomain Parameters in Route Helpers
- **Issue**: All newly created view files (modifier-groups, modifiers, menus, menu-items) were missing the `subdomain` parameter in route() helper calls
- **Error**: `UrlGenerationException: Missing parameter for [Route: dashboard.resource.action] [URI: {subdomain}/dashboard/...]`
- **Root Cause**: New views were not following the established multi-tenant routing pattern of explicitly passing subdomain context
- **Impact**: All navigation within these feature modules would fail with missing parameter errors

- **Files Fixed** (51+ route calls updated across 9 Blade templates):
  - **Modifier Groups** (3 files, 14 route calls):
    - `resources/views/dashboard/modifier-groups/create.blade.php` - 4 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/modifier-groups/edit.blade.php` - 4 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/modifier-groups/index.blade.php` - 6 route calls fixed
  
  - **Modifiers** (3 files, 10 route calls):
    - `resources/views/dashboard/modifiers/create.blade.php` - 3 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/modifiers/edit.blade.php` - 3 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/modifiers/index.blade.php` - 4 route calls fixed
  
  - **Menus** (4 files, 22 route calls):
    - `resources/views/dashboard/menus/create.blade.php` - 3 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/menus/edit.blade.php` - 8 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/menus/index.blade.php` - 6 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/menus/show.blade.php` - 5 route calls fixed
  
  - **Menu Items** (2 files, 6 route calls):
    - `resources/views/dashboard/menu-items/create.blade.php` - 3 route calls fixed
    - `resources/views/dashboard/menu-items/edit.blade.php` - 3 route calls fixed

- **Pattern Applied**: All route() calls updated to include subdomain parameter:
  ```blade
  // Before
  route('dashboard.modifier-groups.index')
  
  // After
  route('dashboard.modifier-groups.index', ['subdomain' => request()->route('subdomain')])
  ```

- **Examples of Fixed Routes**:
  - Modifier Groups: `route('dashboard.modifier-groups.index')`, `route('dashboard.modifiers.create')`, `route('dashboard.modifier-groups.store')`
  - Modifiers: `route('dashboard.modifiers.sync-loyverse')`, `route('dashboard.modifiers.index')`, `route('dashboard.modifiers.toggle')`
  - Menus: `route('dashboard.menus.show')`, `route('dashboard.menus.items.create')`, `route('dashboard.menus.items.reorder')`
  - Menu Items: `route('dashboard.menus.edit')`, `route('dashboard.menus.items.store')`, `route('dashboard.modifier-groups.create')`

## [Date: 2025-10-20] - Critical Tenant Subdomain Authentication Fixes

### Fixed - CRITICAL BUG
- **Subdomain Extraction with Port Numbers in IdentifyTenant Middleware**
  - Files:
    - `app/Http/Middleware/IdentifyTenant.php`
  - Details: Fixed critical bug where subdomain extraction included port numbers (`:8000`)
  - Issue:
    - Accessing `demo.localhost:8000` was detecting subdomain as `demo:8000` instead of `demo`
    - Tenant lookup failed because subdomain stored as `demo` but searched for `demo:8000`
    - Caused 404 errors and authentication failures on all tenant subdomains
  - Root Cause:
    - `str_replace('.'.$appDomain, '', $host)` was operating on full host including port
    - Laravel route domain patterns don't include ports, but `$request->getHost()` does
  - Resolution:
    - Added `explode(':', $host)[0]` to remove port before subdomain extraction
    - Updated logic: `demo.localhost:8000` → `demo.localhost` → `demo` (correct)
  - Impact:
    - Tenant subdomain authentication now works correctly
    - No more 419 CSRF errors from cross-domain redirects
    - Session sharing works properly across subdomains

### Added
- **Authentication Debug Capabilities**
  - Files:
    - `app/Http/Middleware/DebugAuthentication.php` (temporary - for debugging)
    - Debug routes in `routes/tenant.php`
  - Details: Added comprehensive debugging for authentication flow troubleshooting
  - Features:
    - Logs request/response details for authentication routes
    - Debug route to inspect session, tenant context, and subdomain detection
    - Health check route to verify tenant routing works
  - Routes:
    - `GET /health` - Basic tenant routing verification
    - `GET /debug-session` - Comprehensive session and tenant debugging

### Added
- **Test User Creation Command**
  - Files:
    - `app/Console/Commands/CreateTestUser.php`
    - `app/Console/Commands/TestSubdomainParsing.php`
  - Details: Added artisan commands for creating test users and testing subdomain parsing
  - Usage:
    - `php artisan test:create-user demo@test.com "Demo User" demo`
    - `php artisan test:subdomain "demo.localhost:8000"`

### Added
- **Documentation and Testing Guides**
  - Files:
    - `AUTHENTICATION_FIXES.md` - Complete fix documentation and testing guide
    - `SUBDOMAIN_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step testing instructions
  - Details: Comprehensive guides for testing tenant subdomain authentication

### Status
- **CRITICAL FIX COMPLETE**: Tenant subdomain authentication fully working
- **VERIFIED**: Session sharing across subdomains working correctly
- **TESTED**: CSRF tokens work properly on tenant subdomains
- **CONFIRMED**: No cross-domain redirects during authentication

## [Date: 2025-10-20] - Multi-Tenant Routing & Authentication Fixes

### Fixed
- **Session Cookie Domain & Auth Form Action URLs for Multi-Tenant Subdomains**
  - Files:
    - `.env`
    - `.env.example`
    - `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
    - `resources/views/auth/forgot-password.blade.php`
    - `resources/views/auth/reset-password.blade.php`
    - `resources/views/auth/confirm-password.blade.php`
  - Details: Fixed CSRF token mismatch (419 error) and subdomain redirect when logging in on tenant subdomains
  - Issue:
    - Accessing `demo.localhost:8000/login` loaded the login page
    - After submitting login form, redirected to `localhost:8000/login` with 419 error
    - Error: "POST http://localhost:8000/login 419 (unknown status)"
    - User loses tenant subdomain context during authentication
  - Root Causes:
    1. `SESSION_DOMAIN` was set to `null` in `.env`
       - Session cookies were scoped to exact domain (e.g., `demo.localhost:8000`)
       - When redirecting to `localhost:8000`, session cookie was not available
       - CSRF token validation failed due to missing session
    2. Auth form actions used `route()` helper which generated absolute URLs
       - `action="{{ route('login') }}"` generated `http://localhost:8000/login` using APP_URL
       - Form submission redirected to base domain, losing tenant subdomain
       - Links like "Forgot your password?" also generated absolute URLs
  - Resolution:
    1. Session Domain:
       - Changed `SESSION_DOMAIN=null` to `SESSION_DOMAIN=.localhost` (with leading dot)
       - This allows session cookies to be shared across all subdomains
       - Ran `php artisan config:clear` and `php artisan cache:clear` to apply changes
    2. Form Actions & Links:
       - Changed all auth form actions from `route()` to relative paths (e.g., `/login`)
       - Changed `action="{{ route('login') }}"` to `action="/login"`
       - Changed `action="{{ route('password.email') }}"` to `action="/forgot-password"`
       - Changed `action="{{ route('password.store') }}"` to `action="/reset-password"`
       - Changed `action="{{ route('password.confirm') }}"` to `action="/confirm-password"`
       - Changed password reset link from `route('password.request')` to `/forgot-password`
       - Ran `php artisan view:clear` to clear compiled views
  - Impact:
    - Login now works correctly on all tenant subdomains without subdomain loss
    - Session and CSRF tokens are shared across `localhost`, `demo.localhost`, `admin.localhost`
    - All auth forms (login, password reset, etc.) stay on tenant subdomain
    - For production with real domain (e.g., `example.com`), use `SESSION_DOMAIN=.example.com`

- **Auth Routes Missing from Tenant Subdomains & Redirect Issues**
  - Files:
    - `routes/tenant.php`
    - `bootstrap/app.php`
  - Details: Fixed 404 errors on tenant login pages and subdomain redirect issues
  - Issues:
    - Accessing `demo.localhost:8000/login` returned 404 (route not found)
    - `demo.localhost:8000` redirected to `localhost:8000/login` (wrong domain, lost subdomain)
    - "Missing parameter: subdomain" error when trying to access dashboard
  - Root Cause:
    - Auth routes (login, logout, password reset, etc.) were NOT included in tenant routes
    - Laravel's auth middleware was using `route('login')` which defaulted to `localhost/login`
    - APP_URL configuration caused absolute redirects losing subdomain
  - Resolution:
    - Added `require __DIR__.'/auth.php';` to `routes/tenant.php`
    - Added `$middleware->redirectGuestsTo(fn () => '/login');` in bootstrap/app.php to use relative path
  - Impact:
    - Login now works on all tenant subdomains
    - Unauthenticated users stay on their subdomain when redirected to login
    - All auth features (login, logout, password reset) work on tenant subdomains

- **Missing Root Route for Tenant Subdomains & Route Generation Errors**
  - Files:
    - `routes/tenant.php`
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/OnboardingController.php`
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/InvitationController.php`
    - `resources/views/landing/layout.blade.php`
    - `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php`
  - Details: Fixed multiple instances of `route('dashboard')` causing "Missing parameter: subdomain" errors across controllers and views
  - Issue: "Missing required parameter for [Route: dashboard] [URI: dashboard] [Missing parameter: subdomain]"
  - Root Cause:
    - Tenant routes only defined `/dashboard` and other paths, no root route
    - Using `route('dashboard')` helper on tenant subdomains requires subdomain parameter
    - Multiple controllers were using `route('dashboard')` without parameters
  - Resolution:
    - Added `Route::get('/', fn() => redirect('/dashboard'))` in tenant routes
    - Changed all `route('dashboard')` to `redirect('/dashboard')` in tenant controllers
    - AuthenticatedSessionController: Changed login redirect to use path
    - OnboardingController: Fixed complete() and skip() methods
    - InvitationController: Fixed accept() method redirect
    - Landing page layout: Build tenant dashboard URL manually with subdomain for authenticated users
    - Tenant navigation: Changed to relative paths ('/dashboard') instead of named routes
  - Impact: All three domains now work correctly:
    - `localhost:8000` → Landing page works without errors
    - `admin.localhost:8000` → Super admin panel works
    - `demo.localhost:8000` → Tenant dashboard works

- **Tenant Context Not Set for Dashboard**
  - Files: `bootstrap/app.php`
  - Details: Fixed `IdentifyTenant` middleware not being applied to tenant routes
  - Issue: `Undefined array key "product_mappings"` error when accessing tenant dashboard
  - Root Cause:
    - `IdentifyTenant` middleware wasn't registered as an alias
    - Middleware wasn't applied to tenant domain routes
    - Tenant context was never set, so tenant-scoped queries failed
  - Resolution:
    - Registered `identify.tenant` middleware alias in `bootstrap/app.php`
    - Applied middleware to tenant domain route group: `middleware(['web', 'identify.tenant'])`
    - Now tenant context is properly set before dashboard controller runs
  - Impact: All tenant-scoped models (Order, ProductMapping, SyncLog, etc.) now work correctly

- **Super Admin Dashboard Data Issues**
  - Files: `app/Http/Controllers/SuperAdmin/DashboardController.php`
  - Details: Fixed multiple undefined variable errors in super admin dashboard
  - Issues Fixed:
    - `$recentActivity` variable undefined - created from recent tenants data
    - Chart data not properly formatted - added 'labels' and 'data' arrays for Chart.js
    - Variable name mismatch - changed compact() to pass correct variable names
  - Root Cause: View expected variables that weren't being passed from controller
  - Resolution:
    - Formatted chart data with proper structure for Chart.js
    - Created `$recentActivity` by transforming recent tenants into activity log format
    - Updated compact() to pass `revenueChartData`, `orderVolumeData`, `tenantGrowthData`, `recentActivity`

- **Subscription Relationship Alias**
  - Files: `app/Models/Subscription.php`
  - Details: Added `subscriptionPlan()` method as alias for `plan()` relationship
  - Issue: `RelationNotFoundException` when accessing `$subscription->subscriptionPlan` in views/controllers
  - Root Cause: Relationship defined as `plan()` but accessed as `subscriptionPlan` in super admin views
  - Resolution: Added alias method for backward compatibility without changing all view/controller references

### Added
- **Tenant Routes File**
  - Files: `routes/tenant.php`
  - Details: Separate route file for tenant-specific routes
    - All tenant dashboard routes moved from web.php
    - Orders, product mappings, sync logs
    - API credentials, team invitations
    - Subscription management, onboarding wizard
    - Profile routes
  - Only accessible via tenant subdomains (demo.localhost, etc.)
  - Automatically isolated from admin and public routes

### Added
- **TestUserSeeder**
  - Files: `database/seeders/TestUserSeeder.php`
  - Details: Comprehensive seeder that creates:
    - Super Admin user (admin@saas.test)
    - Test Tenant ("Demo Restaurant" with subdomain "demo")
    - Tenant Admin user (admin@demo.test)

  - Features:
    - Automatic role assignment
    - Proper tenant association
    - Clear console output with credentials
    - Instructions for subdomain setup

### Fixed
- **Route Isolation & Subdomain Routing**
  - Files:
    - `bootstrap/app.php`
    - `routes/web.php`
    - `routes/tenant.php` (new)
  - Details:
    - **CRITICAL FIX**: Separated routes by domain to prevent cross-contamination
    - Route structure now:
      - `admin.localhost` → Super Admin routes ONLY
      - `localhost` / `www.localhost` → Public/Landing routes ONLY
      - `{subdomain}.localhost` → Tenant routes ONLY (dashboard, orders, etc.)
    - Updated `web.php` to only contain public routes
    - Created `routes/tenant.php` for all tenant dashboard routes
    - Fixed bootstrap/app.php to register routes in correct order
    - Issue: All routes were accessible on all subdomains (admin could access tenant dashboard, tenants could access admin routes)
    - Root Cause: No domain restriction on routes in web.php
    - Resolution: Explicit domain-based route registration with proper isolation

- **Super Admin Login Redirect Issue**
  - Files:
    - `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php`
    - `bootstrap/app.php`
    - `config/app.php`
    - `.env.example`
  - Details:
    - Added `APP_DOMAIN` and `ADMIN_SUBDOMAIN` configuration
    - Updated `bootstrap/app.php` to use explicit domain config for super admin routes
    - Fixed login redirect to check user role and redirect appropriately:
      - Super admins → `super-admin.dashboard`
      - Tenant users → `dashboard`
    - Fixed logout to redirect based on subdomain
    - Issue: Super admins were being redirected to tenant dashboard after login
    - Root Cause: Missing domain configuration and role-based redirect logic
    - Resolution: Smart redirect based on user role + domain configuration

- **User Model hasRole() Method**
  - Fixed SQL query error in `hasRole()` method
  - Changed from `when()` clause to explicit `if` statement
  - Properly handles `wherePivot()` for tenant_id filtering
  - Issue: Was generating invalid SQL with `pivot = tenant_id`
  - Resolution: Explicit query building for tenant_id filtering

### Fixed
- **Registration Route Conflict**
  - Removed duplicate `register` route from `routes/auth.php` (Laravel Breeze)
  - SaaS registration now uses `landing.register` route from Landing\RegistrationController
  - Updated `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` to reference `route('landing.register')`
  - Cleared route cache to ensure changes take effect
  - Issue: Multiple routes were trying to use `/register` path causing route definition error
  - Resolution: Removed old Breeze registration routes in favor of SaaS multi-tenant registration flow
