  - Files:
    - `app/Jobs/SyncToLoyverseJob.php` (modified)
  - Details: Added intelligent error handling with separate handlers for LoyverseApiException and general exceptions. Features include: automatic rate limit handling (releases job back to queue with retry delay), server error retry with Laravel's built-in retry mechanism, permanent failure for validation/auth errors, comprehensive SyncLog integration at every step, status tracking (pending → processing → synced/failed), detailed error logging with error codes and metadata.

### Fixed
- Fixed Vite manifest not found error
  - Files:
    - `public/build/manifest.json` (created)
    - `public/build/assets/app-BOunjg3p.css` (created)

### Changed
- Removed Redis dependency - migrated to database drivers
  - Files:
    - `.env` (modified)

This eliminates Redis as a requirement, making the application work with just MySQL. Rate limiting, caching, sessions, and queues now all use database storage. Migrations for sessions, cache, and queue tables already exist and were run successfully.

- Ran database migrations
  - Files:
    - Database tables created: product_mappings, sessions, cache, cache_locks
  - Details: Successfully migrated product_mappings table with proper indexes. Sessions, cache, and queue infrastructure tables already existed from previous migrations.

  - Files:
    - `config/loyverse.php` (created)
  - Details: Comprehensive config file with sections for: API URL and authentication (access token & OAuth), default store/POS device/employee/customer IDs, rate limiting (55 req/min), retry configuration (max attempts, delays, backoff), cache TTLs for all resource types, default receipt settings (type: SALE, source: API, dining_option: DELIVERY), and logging configuration.
