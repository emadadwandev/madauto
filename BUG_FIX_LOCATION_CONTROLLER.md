# Location Controller Bug Fix - October 21, 2025

## Issue
**Error**: `Call to a member function locations() on null`
**Location**: `LocationController.php:16`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Root Cause
The controller was trying to access `auth()->user()->tenant->locations()` but the tenant relationship wasn't loaded on the User model, resulting in null.

## Solution
Changed the index method to use direct query filtering by tenant_id instead of relying on the relationship:

```php
// Before (incorrect)
$locations = auth()->user()->tenant->locations()
    ->paginate(12);

// After (correct)
$tenant_id = auth()->user()->tenant_id;
$locations = Location::where('tenant_id', $tenant_id)
    ->paginate(12);
```

## Why This Works
- The User model has `tenant_id` field directly available
- We query the Location model directly and filter by tenant_id
- Avoids the need to load the Tenant relationship
- More efficient query execution
- Follows Laravel best practices for multi-tenant applications

## Files Modified
- `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/LocationController.php` - Line 16

## Testing
The fix has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ No more null pointer exceptions
- ✅ Locations list displays correctly
- ✅ Pagination works as expected
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation maintained

## Notes
This same pattern should be used throughout the application for consistency and performance in multi-tenant architectures.
