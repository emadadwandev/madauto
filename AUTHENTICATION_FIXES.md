# TENANT SUBDOMAIN AUTHENTICATION FIXES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Critical Fix: Subdomain Extraction with Port Numbers

**Problem**: The `IdentifyTenant` middleware was including port numbers (`:8000`) in subdomain detection, causing tenant lookup to fail.

**Before**: 
- `demo.localhost:8000` → subdomain detected as `demo:8000` 
- Tenant lookup failed because subdomain was stored as `demo`

**After**: 
- `demo.localhost:8000` → subdomain detected as `demo`
- Tenant lookup succeeds

**File**: `app/Http/Middleware/IdentifyTenant.php`

### 2. Added Debugging Capabilities

**Added**: 
- Debug middleware to log authentication flow
- Debug routes to inspect session and tenant context
- Health check route to verify tenant routing

**Files**:
- `app/Http/Middleware/DebugAuthentication.php` 
- Debug routes in `routes/tenant.php`

### 3. Verification of Session Configuration

**Confirmed**: Session settings are correct for subdomain sharing:
- `SESSION_DOMAIN=.localhost` - Allows session sharing across subdomains
- `SESSION_DRIVER=database` - Appropriate for development/production

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Update Windows Hosts File

Add these entries to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.0.1 admin.localhost  
127.0.0.1 demo.localhost
127.0.0.1 www.localhost
```

### Step 2: Start Laravel Server

```powershell
cd e:\2025\dev\Careem\careem-loyverse-integration
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

### Step 3: Test Health Check

Visit: http://demo.localhost:8000/health

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Tenant routing is working",
  "host": "demo.localhost",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T16:45:00.000000Z"
}
```

### Step 4: Test Debug Route

Visit: http://demo.localhost:8000/debug-session

Expected response should show:
- `subdomain_detection`: `"demo"`
- `tenant_context`: Object with Demo Restaurant details
- `session_domain`: `".localhost"`

### Step 5: Test Login Flow

1. Visit: http://demo.localhost:8000
2. Should redirect to: http://demo.localhost:8000/login  
3. Login with:
   - Email: `demo@test.com`
   - Password: `password`
4. Should redirect to: http://demo.localhost:8000/dashboard

### Step 6: Check Logs

If issues persist, check:

```powershell
# Laravel logs with authentication debug info
Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Tail 20

# Server access logs
# Check the terminal running `php artisan serve`
```

## Expected Fixes

1. ✅ **No more 419 CSRF errors** - Session/CSRF tokens now work correctly across subdomains
2. ✅ **No cross-domain redirects** - Authentication stays on tenant subdomain  
3. ✅ **Proper tenant context** - Tenant data is correctly identified and loaded
4. ✅ **Session persistence** - Login state maintained on tenant subdomain

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to remove the debug middleware:

1. Remove `'debug.auth'` from `bootstrap/app.php`
2. Remove debug routes from `routes/tenant.php`
3. Delete `app/Http/Middleware/DebugAuthentication.php`

## Additional Notes

- Super admin routes (`admin.localhost:8000`) should continue working as before
- Main domain routes (`localhost:8000`) for landing page should work
- Each tenant has isolated sessions and data

The core issue was the subdomain extraction including port numbers, which is now fixed. Test the login flow and let me know if you encounter any remaining issues.
