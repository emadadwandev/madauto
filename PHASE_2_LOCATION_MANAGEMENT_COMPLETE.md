# Phase 2 Implementation Complete: Location Management System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete **Location Management System** for the multi-tenant menu management platform. This Phase 2 implementation provides restaurants with the ability to manage multiple physical locations, each with their own opening hours, platform assignments, and busy mode status.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. LocationController (CRUD & Actions)
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/LocationController.php`

**Operations**:
- ✅ Index - Display all tenant locations (paginated)
- ✅ Create - Show location creation form
- ✅ Store - Save new location with validation
- ✅ Edit - Show location editing form
- ✅ Update - Update existing location
- ✅ Destroy - Delete location
- ✅ Toggle - Toggle location active/inactive status
- ✅ ToggleBusy - Toggle location busy mode

**Security**:
- Tenant isolation via `authorizeLocation()` method
- All routes protected with `auth` middleware
- Prevents cross-tenant data access

### 2. Location Model Enhancements
**File**: `app/Models/Location.php` (already existed, used by controller)

**Added Relationships**:
- `locations()` relationship added to Tenant model

**Helper Methods**:
- `isOpenNow()` - Check if currently open
- `toggleBusyMode()` - Toggle busy status
- `addPlatform()` / `removePlatform()` - Manage platforms
- `supportsPlatform()` - Check platform support

### 3. User Interface Views

#### Index View: `resources/views/dashboard/locations/index.blade.php`
**Features**:
- Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile → 3 cols desktop)
- Location cards with:
  - Name, city, address
  - Status badges (Active/Inactive, Available/Busy)
  - Contact info (phone, email)
  - Connected platforms
  - Today's opening hours + "Currently Open/Closed" indicator
- Quick actions: Edit, Mark Busy, Delete
- Empty state with CTA for new locations
- Pagination support
- JavaScript for AJAX busy toggle and delete confirmation

#### Create View: `resources/views/dashboard/locations/create.blade.php`
**Form Sections**:
1. **Basic Information**: Name, email, phone
2. **Address**: Complete address details
3. **Platforms**: Checkbox selection (Careem/Talabat)
4. **Opening Hours**: Time picker for each day (optional)
5. **Loyverse Integration**: Store ID mapping

**Validation**:
- Required fields: name, address_line1, city, country, platforms
- Optional fields: address_line2, state, postal_code, email, phone
- Time format validation for opening hours
- Email validation if provided

#### Edit View: `resources/views/dashboard/locations/edit.blade.php`
- Identical form to create view
- Pre-populated with existing location data
- Uses PUT method for updates
- Dynamic opening hours display with current values

### 4. Routing
**File**: `routes/tenant.php`

Added comprehensive route group:
```php
Route::prefix('dashboard/locations')->name('dashboard.locations.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [LocationController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
    Route::get('/create', [LocationController::class, 'create'])->name('create');
    Route::post('/', [LocationController::class, 'store'])->name('store');
    Route::get('/{location}/edit', [LocationController::class, 'edit'])->name('edit');
    Route::put('/{location}', [LocationController::class, 'update'])->name('update');
    Route::delete('/{location}', [LocationController::class, 'destroy'])->name('destroy');
    Route::patch('/{location}/toggle', [LocationController::class, 'toggle'])->name('toggle');
    Route::patch('/{location}/toggle-busy', [LocationController::class, 'toggleBusy'])->name('toggle-busy');
});
```

**Route Names**:
- `dashboard.locations.index` - List locations
- `dashboard.locations.create` - Show create form
- `dashboard.locations.store` - Save location
- `dashboard.locations.edit` - Show edit form
- `dashboard.locations.update` - Update location
- `dashboard.locations.destroy` - Delete location
- `dashboard.locations.toggle` - Toggle active status
- `dashboard.locations.toggle-busy` - Toggle busy status

### 5. Navigation Integration
**File**: `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php`

**Changes**:
- Added Locations to Menu Management dropdown (first item)
- Updated active state detection to include `dashboard.locations.*` routes
- Locations now appears before Menus in the dropdown
- Proper subdomain parameter passing in links

**Navigation Order**:
1. Locations ← NEW
2. Menus
3. Modifiers
4. Modifier Groups

### 6. Model Relationships
**Updated File**: `app/Models/Tenant.php`

Added relationship:
```php
public function locations(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(Location::class);
}
```

This allows:
```php
$tenant->locations() // Get all locations for tenant
$tenant->locations()->active() // Get active locations only
```

## Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Platform Support
✅ Each location can serve Careem, Talabat, or both
✅ Platform assignment via checkboxes
✅ Easy add/remove platform functionality

### Opening Hours Management
✅ Set different hours for each day of week
✅ Optional - leave empty if closed
✅ Time format validation (HH:mm)
✅ "Currently Open/Closed" status display based on local time

### Busy Mode
✅ Quick toggle to pause orders at location
✅ Useful for kitchen rush or unexpected issues
✅ Status visible on location cards

### Active/Inactive Status
✅ Enable/disable locations without deletion
✅ Useful for seasonal or temporary closures
✅ Quick toggle via button

### Loyverse Integration
✅ Optional mapping of location to Loyverse store
✅ Store ID field for POS integration
✅ Foundation for Phase 5 (Menu Publishing)

### Tenant Isolation
✅ All locations strictly scoped to tenant
✅ Cannot access other tenant's locations
✅ Authorization check in every operation

## Database Schema (From Phase 1)
```sql
CREATE TABLE locations (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    tenant_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_line1 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    address_line2 VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    state VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    postal_code VARCHAR(20) NULL,
    country VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    platforms JSON, -- ["careem", "talabat"]
    opening_hours JSON, -- {"monday": {"open": "09:00", "close": "22:00"}, ...}
    is_busy BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    loyverse_store_id VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    metadata JSON NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## Testing Checklist

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/Dashboard/LocationController.php` - Main controller
2. ✅ `resources/views/dashboard/locations/index.blade.php` - Location list view
3. ✅ `resources/views/dashboard/locations/create.blade.php` - Location creation form
4. ✅ `resources/views/dashboard/locations/edit.blade.php` - Location editing form

### Modified Files:
1. ✅ `app/Models/Tenant.php` - Added locations() relationship
2. ✅ `routes/tenant.php` - Added location routes + LocationController import
3. ✅ `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php` - Added locations to menu dropdown
4. ✅ `changelog.md` - Documented Phase 2 completion

## Resolution of Original Error
**Original Error**: `Route [dashboard.locations.create] not defined`

**Root Cause**: The menu creation view was trying to link to `dashboard.locations.create` route which didn't exist because Phase 2 (Location Management) hadn't been implemented yet.

**Solution**: Implemented complete Phase 2 with LocationController and all necessary routes, allowing users to create locations before creating menus.

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Enhanced Order Processing
- Update OrderTransformerService to use location context
- Ensure orders are processed with location-specific mappings
- Test modifier support with real orders

### Phase 4: Menu Publishing (Optional Enhancement)
- Publish menus to specific locations
- Sync menus to Careem/Talabat APIs per location
- Track publication status

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Optional)
- Location analytics (orders by location)
- Location-specific reports
- Busy mode automation based on order volume
- Integration with delivery platform APIs for real-time updates

## Performance Considerations

✅ **Pagination**: Index view uses pagination (12 items per page)
✅ **Query Optimization**: Uses tenant scope to limit queries
✅ **N+1 Prevention**: Pre-filter by tenant_id before fetching locations
✅ **Indexing**: Database indexes on tenant_id and is_active/is_busy columns recommended

## Security Summary

✅ **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
✅ **Authentication**: All routes require `auth` middleware
✅ **Authorization**: Tenant isolation enforced via `authorizeLocation()`
✅ **Input Validation**: Server-side validation on all inputs
✅ **Subdomain Isolation**: Uses multi-tenant subdomain routing

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Date Completed**: October 21, 2025
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Ready for**: Production testing or Phase 3 implementation
